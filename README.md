# CakeFactory
An implementation of a client - server program for multiple users

Allows multiple users to collaboratively plan and choose cakes for future events.

Users can create accounts to check into private rooms

Also supports native chat

This was originally a project I created for a class a couple of years ago
This is designed as a proof of concept for Client server communication. For this reason it is built from the ground up and security and storage were not considered.


#Server
Will run on Java versions 1.7+
Once compiled can be started with "Java CakeServer"
Port 16789 must be open and reachable to ensure proper functionality. 

#Client
Runs on any desktop using with JRE 1.7+
Run from "CakeFactoryClient"
